Once upon a time in the pulsating heart of the city, there lived a DJ. With beats as sharp as his tongue, he ruled the nightclub scene with an iron fist and a sour attitude. Jealousy simmered like a cauldron, bubbling over at the success of every other DJ who dared to share the limelight.

His days were consumed by endless Facebook battles, where he waged war with rival DJs over petty squabbles and imagined slights. Arguments raged like storms in the comment section, each word a lightning bolt of vitriol hurled in the heat of the moment.

But amidst the chaos of his online feuds, one thing consumed his thoughts above all else: his birthday. Oh, how he cherished that sacred day, believing the world owed him a grand celebration fit for a king. He'd remind anyone within earshot of the impending occasion, demanding their adoration and worship like a petulant child.

Yet, despite his venomous nature, his birthday arrived like any other day, met with indifference from those he antagonized. And as the sun set on another year, he realized that true happiness couldn't be found in the echoes of his own ego or the hollow victories of online skirmishes.

For in the end, it was the music that mattered mostâ€”the universal language that transcended petty rivalries and selfish desires. And as his beats faded into the night, he finally understood that the true measure of a DJ wasn't found in fame or notoriety, but in the joy they brought to others through the power of their music.
